The Linear Regression model's 82.12% historical accuracy lending weight to its -0.76% prediction cannot be ignored, despite the more extreme -50.38% figure from the ensemble.\n\nHowever, I question the Market Expert's interpretation of an RSI of 50 as purely \"neutral.\" In a strong trending market, this can indicate a loss of momentum and often precedes a directional break. Combined with the MACD bearish crossover mentioned, this supports the sell signal, not contradicts it.\n\nThe most critical technical risk I see is the severe model divergence highlighted by the Risk Analyst. The gap between the -0.76% and -50.38% predictions is a major red flag, indicating high market instability.

The extreme divergence between Linear Regression (-0.76%) and AI Model (-50.38%) predictions suggests underlying data or methodology issues that warrant caution.\n\n**Liquidity Risk Overlooked**: Market Expert's fund flow analysis aligns with my concerns about accelerating capital outflows. If the predicted -50% materializes, we face severe liquidity risk - the market may not absorb large sell orders without catastrophic slippage.\n\n**Contradiction Resolution**: The neutral RSI vs bearish models isn't necessarily contradictory. It may indicate market complacency - precisely when tail risks are most dangerous.
